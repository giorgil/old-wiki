# DokuWiki Contents

Those are the contents of the old DokuWiki that was hosted at merbivore.com.
The plan was, and still is, to transfer the useful parts to the github wiki;
however, the markup is not directly supported, so it will need manual
conversion.

## Structure

* `attic`: gzip'd history snapshots. The numeric value in the file names is
  the Unix timestamp of the change.
* `pages`: Latest versions of the pages.
* `meta`: Metadata. The most interesting thing in there are likely the
  `.changes` files, which list modification details. You are welcome to
  rebuild the history from those in a git repository.
* `media`: A few pictures.
