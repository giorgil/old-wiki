====== Serving Static Content ======

You can pop static HTML pages into the ''public'' directory of your Merb app, and your web server will bypass your app and render them. 

For instance:
<code>
$ cd my_merb_app
$ echo "<h1>Hello World</h1>" > public/hello.html
</code>

Visit ''http://localhost:4000/hello.html'', and your static HTML will appear!
