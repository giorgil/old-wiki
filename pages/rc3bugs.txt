RC3 has one major known bug:
  * An accidental change to dependency broke use_template_engine :haml. This will be resolved in a quick RC4, which will be released tomorrow.
    * Temporary workaround: add the following code under use_template_engine: <code RUBY>dependency "merb-haml", :immediate => true</code>
