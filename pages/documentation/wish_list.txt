====== Documentation Wish List ======

===== General =====

==== Architectural Documentation ====

The [[http://ghettochip.com/merb_internals|Merb Internals Handbook]] covers how different bits of Merb's architecture hang together. 

FIXME: add some diagrams. 

===== RDoc, etc. =====

See [[documentation/rdoc]] for links about RDoc, per se.


==== General ====

=== Data harvesting ===

RDoc does not harvest all of the data it could
from either the code or comments.
A full parse of the code would, for example,
yield information on:

  * locations where methods are called

  * locations where non-local variables are used

  * method visibility (eg, ''private'', ''protected'', ''public'')

Other metadata could be extracted from comments
(eg, Merb's ''@plugin'', ''@private'', and ''@public'' tags).


=== Interface information ===

It would be useful for API documentation to include information
on interfaces, as discussed in Ken Pugh's book,
"Interface-Oriented Design".
For example:

  * exceptions (handled, raised, etc)

  * pre- and post-conditions

  * return values (eg, typical, possible) from methods

=== Namespace integration ===

It would be convenient for the programmer
to be able to view integrated API documentation.
That is, documentation for all classess and methods
that are relevant to a given framework (eg, Merb, Rails) or application.

The specification of an app's namespace would be tedious to specify manually.
However, it could be harvested from the app
by means of code running in (say) ''merb -i'' or ''script/console''.
A short-form URL could then be generated to reference this "view".


==== Generated HTML ====

There are a variety of templates for RDoc;
in fact, each API site seems to use a different one!
So, some of the comments below are relevant only
to (the template used on) a particular site.

=== General ===

== Syntax-based code highlighting and navigation ==

RDoc does not offer syntax-based code highlighting or navigation in its HTML output.


=== merbivore.com ===

These items relate to http://merbivore.com/documentation.html.

== broken parsing ==

In many cases, comment text is incorrectly interpreted as embedded code.
For example, see ''creat()'' under methods.

== disclosure control ==

This should include some form of disclosure control
for the "Source Code" section on the "files" pages
(eg, something that allows a single method to be viewed).

== ''file:'' heading ==

If the file path exceeds 66 characters,
the yellow ''file:'' heading spills out of its gray background
onto the white page below.
This is ugly and hard to read.
Also, the same information is given in the ''Path:'' heading below.

== printing vs. style ==

The Source Code is printed as white-on-black (sometimes including green).
This doesn't print well on many printers;
it also uses up huge amounts of ink.

There should be a way to eliminate the "chrome"
(eg, left navigation sidebar) from the page.

Attempting to print the page using Firefox
yields a long list of links,
rather than the content of any particular (internal) page.

== redundant header ==

The header "Documentation for RDoc Documentation" is redundanant.

=== ruby-doc.org ===

These items relate to http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/,
http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/,
and http://spec.ruby-doc.org/wiki.

== viewing code in File section ==

It would be handy to be able to use the Files section
on www.ruby-doc.org to view entire files,
as supported on merbivore.com.

== markup ignored ==

On http://spec.ruby-doc.org/wiki,
some markup (eg, _, +) is being ignored
For example, see http://spec.ruby-doc.org/wiki/Array.

== update needed ==

The [[http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/|Ruby Standard Library Documentation]]
was last updated in 2005.


=== rubyonrails.org ===

These items relate primarily to http://api.rubyonrails.org/ and
http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/,
with occasional references to http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/.

== viewing code in File section ==

It would be handy to be able to use the File section
to view entire files, as supported on merbivore.com.

== printing vs. style ==

The headers is printed as white-on-blue.
This uses up excessive amounts of ink.

There should be a way to eliminate the "chrome"
(eg, left navigation sidebar) from the page.

== update needed ==

The Ruby documentation is rather out of date.
The [[http://corelib.rubyonrails.org/|Core Library]] documentation covers Ruby 1.8.4;
The [[http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/|Ruby Standard Library Documentation]]
was last updated in 2005.
