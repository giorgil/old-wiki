====== Autocreating/autoupdating your database on spec run ======

Specs not running because of your non-existent test database?  Tired of setting your environment to test and running rake db:automigrate?  Try adding the following to your spec/spec_helper.rb in Spec::Runner.config block:

<code ruby>
  config.before(:all) do
    DataMapper.auto_migrate!
  end
</code>

Need transactions in your specs, check [[testing/rspec/datamapper-transactions|this entry]]

===== Note =====

It's worth saying that this is unnecessary if you generated your app with one of the newer version of Merb as the spec/spec_helper.rb already contains the following code.

<code ruby>
config.before(:all) do
  DataMapper.auto_migrate! if Merb.orm == :datamapper
end
