====== Could not find RubyGem spicycode-rcov ======

Rspec 1.1.9 includes a dependency on spicycode-rcov, a fork of rcov hosted on GitHub.  It is designed to be a developer dependency, but that requires RubyGems 1.3.0 or higher.

If you are seeing this error, you have several choices:

  * Upgrade to RSpec 1.1.10
  * Upgrade to RubyGems 1.3.0 (You may need to reinstall Rspec after upgrading RubyGems)
  * Install spicycode-rcov (see below). This is recommended if you actually use rcov, because the fork has many improvements
  * Downgrade rspec to 1.1.8

===== Installing from GitHub =====
  gem install --source http://gems.github.com spicycode-rcov
