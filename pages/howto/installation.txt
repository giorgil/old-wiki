===== Do I want gems or edge? =====

"edge" is what most people refer to as "trunk" in the svn world.  It represents the cutting edge of the source.  As such, most people don't actually need it.

Get edge only if one of the following is true:
  * You want to help develop merb
  * You like having the latest and greatest, even if it means the possibility of having more bugs or undocumented changes
  * There's a bug in the current gem that's fixed in edge and you absolutely must have the fix right now (p.s. no you don't)
  * You don't mind the hassle of installing/using git instead of rubygems to stay up to date

If none of those sound like you, please install from gems.
