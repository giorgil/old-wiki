====== Merb Edge ======

[[http://github.com/merb/merb|Edge Merb]] is only meant for people who know what they are doing. For the majority of users, we **strongly** recommend [[howto/installation/gems|installing using stable gems]]. 

===== Nightly gems: the easy way =====

<code>$ sudo gem install merb --source http://edge.merbivore.com</code>

The edge gems are released nightly and are not recommended in production.

WARNING: This is currently failing as of November 14th unless you first have datamapper installed. To install datamapper do

<code shell>
$ sudo gem install dm-core dm-more
</code>

See DataMapper's [[http://datamapper.org/getting-started.html|getting started]] guide for more details.
===== Using Git: the hard and not so recommended way =====


Merb ''core'' and ''more'' gems are available from our main git repository: [[http://github.com/merb/merb]]

On top of the release branches, you will find 2 other branches:

  * ''master'' (aka edge managed by the gatekeeper, usually wycats)
  * ''active'' (working branch the core developers commit to)

==== Prerequisites ====

Set up edge Merb gem dependencies with the following command:

<code>
$ sudo gem install rake rack rspec mongrel hoe templater bundler
</code>

==== Installing by hand ====

To install from edge, start by cloning the repo:

<code>
$ git clone git://github.com/merb/merb.git
</code>

Then ''cd'' into the repo and install what you need using the available rake tasks. You can either use the rake task at the root of the git branch: 

<code>
$ cd merb
$ sudo rake install 
</code>

or go into each component's directory and install it separately: 

<code>
$ cd merb/merb-core
$ sudo rake install 
$ cd ../merb-auth
$ sudo rake install 
</code>
