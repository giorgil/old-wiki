====== Text editors ======

===== Vim =====

[[http://rails.vim.tpope.net/|vim-rails]] now has basic support for merb. 

**Mini HOWTO:**

  $ cd /tmp
  $ git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-rails.git
  $ cd vim-rails; rake install

Now the plugin is installed, but it needs a small workaround to detect your merb app:

  $ cd $MERB_ROOT
  $ touch config/environment.rb


There are some useful scripts for Vim :

    * Note: I find Aptana's Ruby mode to be more helpful than its Rails mode, personally  --- //[[nanodeath@gmail.com|Max Aller]] 2008/11/16 21:16//
