===== CRUD view examples =====

CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete. Often, web developers decide to follow this principle and create a few views matching the following actions: 

  * New (to collect the data to create)
  * Create (to actually create an object, no views required: if the creation worked, the user gets redirected, otherwise the new action gets re-rendered)

  * Edit (to edit an existing object)
  * Update (to modify an existing object, doesn't require a view)

  * Delete (to delete an existing object, doesn't require a view)

  * Show (display an object)
  * Index (display a collection of objects)


The actions above are available in your controller and, if you use the generator to create a resource, you will see the methods above plus a few others. However, Merb doesn't generate a view scaffold. People coming from Rails might be surprised and might even consider the Merb team a bit lazy. After all, generating a few views isn't that hard.

The truth is that we used to generate a few views, but we realized that more than 80% of our users ended up totally changing the views. So what's the point? Turns out people were using the scaffolding as a way to learn how to use the various view helpers. Instead we decided to focus more on documentation and hopefully save you from having to always delete generated views.

Most of these views require merb-assets or merb-helpers, if you generated your app doing <code RUBY> merb-gen app my-app</code> then the dependencies should be already set. Otherwise, make sure they are defined in your init.rb file or your dependencies.rb file. (both located in your /config folder)


== Note: ==
dependencies are declared as follows:

<code RUBY> dependency "merb-assets", "1.0" </code> where the first param is the name of the gem/library you need and the second is the version.
