====== Debugging HowTos ======

===== Getting Started =====

Merb uses ruby-debug ("rdebug").  Odds are good you have it installed already, but if not...

  > gem install ruby-debug

To launch merb with ruby-debug enabled add the "-D" flag:

  > merb -D


Hint: If you spend more than a couple minutes using rdebug, you'll want to set up a ~/.rdebugrc file that looks something like this ((merb support for loading ~/.rdebugrc and ./.rdebugrc is broken in 0.9.9, but should be landing in 1.0.  Until then, you can do:
<code>rdebug /usr/bin/merb -- (your merb flags and arguments)</code>)):

  set autolist
  set autoeval
  set autoreload
  set forcestep

... and anything else you may find useful

===== Activating the debugger =====
  
The debugger is activated automatically anytime a ''debugger'' statement is encountered in your code.  For example:

<code RUBY>
  def show
    debugger
    # ... the rest of your code ...
  end
</code>

Another way to activate the debugger is to launch merb with the "-C" option, which instructs merb to open the debugger any time you hit Ctrl-C. Note: [[http://merb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/7433/tickets/597-merb-c-option-is-broken|This feature may be broken]]
===== Using the Debugger =====
rdebug is a full-featured debugger but, unfortunately, good references are a bit hard to come by.  This [[http://bashdb.sourceforge.net/ruby-debug.html | guide for v0.10.1 ]], is the best I've found so far.

Feel free to add any merb-specific tips and tricks here.
