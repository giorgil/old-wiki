====== Dependencies - Require but Awesome ======

If you are requiring a gem that is named differently than the name of the library (like from a Github account) then you need to pass the correct name into require_as:

<code ruby>
dependency("notch8-webrat", :require_as => 'webrat')
dependency 'rest-client', :require_as => 'rest_client'
</code>

You may also use the **:immediate** option, which loads the gem immediately, like this:

<code ruby>
dependency("notch8-webrat", :require_as => 'webrat')
dependency 'rest-client', :require_as => 'rest_client', :immediate => true
dependency 'configatron', :immediate => true
</code>

Dependencies also take a block which is called after the library is required:

<code ruby>
dependency("notch8-webrat", :require_as => 'webrat') { puts "webrat is cool" }
</code>

Also of note, all the win32 utils gems need 
<code ruby>
dependency('win32-process', :require_as => 'win32/process')
