====== Notes on Very Flat Apps: ======

  * to have the app reload itself while in development mode, add this to your file: 
      <code>Merb.push_path(:application,  __FILE__)</code>

  * to have the app reload itself only when the file is modified, try this:
      <code>Merb.push_path(:lib,  File.dirname(__FILE__), File.basename(__FILE__))</code>
