====== Merb Slice Rake tasks ======

A slice has a Rakefile file specifying some settings for your slice and generic tasks.
Other tasks are available in /lib/merb_your_slice_name_slice/*

You can clean up/edit any of the tasks pre-defined for you.

Further more, if you need to load rake tasks from other dependencies such as your ORM (i.e: rake db:automigrate) you will need to load the dependencies for your environment and then load all the plugins so they can load their tasks.

Consider adding the following in your Rakefile. (after requiring merb-core and declaring your other dependencies)

Example of dependencies:
<code RUBY>
require 'rubygems'
require 'rake/gempackagetask'

require 'merb-core'
require 'merb-core/tasks/merb'

dependency 'dm-core'
dependency 'merb_datamapper'
</code>


Code you need to load the merb_datamapper rake tasks such as rake db:automigrate
<code RUBY>
# Load the basic runtime dependencies; this will include 
# any plugins and therefore plugin rake tasks.
init_env = ENV['MERB_ENV'] || 'development'
Merb.load_dependencies(:environment => init_env)

# Get Merb plugins and dependencies
Merb::Plugins.rakefiles.each { |r| require r }
</code>
