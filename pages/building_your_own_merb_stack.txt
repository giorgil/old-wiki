====== Building your own Merb stack ======

The most common and recommend way of installing Merb is by running
<code>
$ sudo gem install merb
</code>
which will pull in a collection of dependencies (''merb-core'', ''merb-more'', ''dm-core'', ''dm-more'') from RubyGems ready for you to build a Merb app. This is known as a Merb 'stack'.

You can create your own stack to provide a standard way of creating new apps with dependencies. This can be really handy for creating a standard distribution of Merb for your own use, saving you from repetitively installing dependencies for each new project.

===== Building a gem =====

**FIXME: flesh out the details, with some code examples**
  - grab a copy of the ''merb'' gemspec (the ''merb'' gem is just a metapackage)
  - make your changes
  - build your gem, and publish

===== Building a thor task =====
