====== Does Merb follow any sort of naming conventions? ======

In general ''merb-foo'' (with a dash) means that a gem is officially maintained, while ''merb_foo'' (with an underscore) means it's a community plugin.

A naming convention for Merb slices is being hashed out on the mailing lists at the moment, but there's a vague consensus on ''merb_slice_foo''.
