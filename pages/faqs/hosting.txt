Several hosting companies now officially support Merb:

  * [[http://www.engineyard.com|Engine Yard]]
  * [[http://www.hostingrails.com/|Hosting Rails]]
  * [[http://dreamhost.com|Dreamhost]]

If you are looking for a VPS, your best bet is to go with [[http://slicehost.com|Slicehost]] or [[http://linode.com|Linode]] where you have complete control. The most common configurations are Apache with [[http://www.modrails.com/|Phusion Passenger]] or [[http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/|Thin]] on Nginx.
