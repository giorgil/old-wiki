These components (except for those with a '*') are the dependencies for a project generated with ''merb-gen'' (as of version 1.0.8.1).

More components can easily be found using, for example, the following commands:

''gem list -d --remote merb''

''gem list -d --remote dm-''

The file ''config/dependencies.rb'' is where the components get 'included', you can add any ruby gem to the dependencies of your app. Using ''thor'' you can bundle all gems with the app to ease distribution and deployment. Use the following command from the root of your app:

''thor merb:gem:install''
