====== Style guidelines when writing pages ======

  * Always make sure there's a **heading** at the top of the page (type some text and use H1 button)
  * **Link appropriately** to other pages and other projects. There's no such thing as too many links.
  * Use ''<code>'' tags whenever **embedding code** examples. You can also specify ''<code ruby>'' for magic syntax highlighting.
  * When including commands running in a shell, **prefix the command** with a ''$'' to indicate that the command should be run as a normal user, or ''#'' for ''root'' (but you shouldn't be using ''root'' anyway, right? That's what ''[[http://www.sudo.ws/|sudo]]'' is for!)
    * e.g. <file>
$ ls /tmp
</file> for a user, and <file>
# ls /tmp
</file> for ''root''.

==== Syntax quirks ====

  * If you need to have code nested within an ordered list, you can do it by starting the ''<code>'' tag on the same line as the point you want it to be under, ie: <file>
  - this is my ordered item <code ruby>
puts 'foo'
</code>
  - another ordered item
</file> (yes; this is dumb)
