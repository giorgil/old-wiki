====== What is Haml and Why Do You Support It? ======

[[http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/|Haml]] is a markup language designed to make the process of creating HTML easier and more efficient.  Haml markup uses indentation to provide structure.

A code example from the Haml web site:

Haml was originally developed for use in Rails applications, and works as a drop-in replacement for ERB.  It is distributed as part of [[http://github.com/wycats/merb-more/tree/master/merb-haml|merb-more]].

===== Using Haml in Merb =====

  - Add the following line to your dependencies.rb: <code ruby>dependency "merb-haml", merb_gems_version</code>
  - Edit your init.rb and update the template engine: <code ruby>use_template_engine :haml</code>
  - Create your templates with the ".html.haml" extension.
  - Write some Haml!

===== Why is it included with the merb stack =====

merb-haml is included with merb because it is a significant performance improvement over Builder for building XML files. We recommend the use of Haml for XML, even if you use ERB for regular HTML templating.

===== Editor Support =====

TextMate users can use the official [[http://macromates.com/svn/Bundles/trunk/Bundles/Ruby%20Haml.tmbundle/|Ruby Haml.tmbundle]].  A [[http://github.com/douglasjarquin/ruby-haml-tmbundle/tree/master|fork]] is available on Github.
